# ME134LData
Data visuaizations for a Materials Engineering course with lab data by using pandas, bokeh, and tkinter. Currently, the script takes a file with 8 properties set above the true data set and puts it into it's own dataframe.

You can choose where you would like the Bokeh HTML file to be saved as well as choose the file using Tkinter.

All data is visualized as circle points so that the specific points can be selected out. Additionally, you can zoom in and out and move around the dataset.
